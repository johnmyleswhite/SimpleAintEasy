# Problem 1

*Using Euclidean distance in high dimensions with sparse data leads to noise*

# Example: 

In bag-of-word models, each corpus is represented as a very sparse vector in a very high dimension. A common next step is to find clusters within the space, or perform some other data-mining technique. Suppose the technique uses the Euclidean norm (also known as the $\el_2$ norm), denoted $|| \cdot ||_2$. Let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ be two vectors in this space. Then:

$$ || \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} ||_2^2 = || \mathbf{x} ||_2^2 + || \mathbf{y} ||_2^2 - \mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y} $$ 

where $\cdot$ denoted the inner product of two vectors. As both vectors are very sparse, the inner product is very close to 0, or more significantly the term $|| \mathbf{x} ||_2^2 + || \mathbf{y} ||_2^2$ is orders of magnitude larger than the inner product. Thus in high dimensions, 

$$ || \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} ||_2^2 \approx || \mathbf{x} ||_2^2 + || \mathbf{y} ||_2^2 $$ 

for sparse vectors, providing us no information about the relationship between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$. 

# Solution 1

In the first equation, the dot product was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the two vectors. Rather than measure distance using the magnitude of vectors, we can choose to define it using the orientation of vectors with respect to each other, which is exactly what the dot product represents:

$$ \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y}}{|| \mathbf{x} ||_2^2 || \mathbf{y} ||_2^2} $$ 

where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. The right-hand side of the above quantity is known as the *cosine similarity*.
